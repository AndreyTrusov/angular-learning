 What is a Component?

 In Angular, components are the core pieces of the UI. Each component controls a specific view (part of the interface) and contains:

 HTML: To define the layout.
 CSS: To style the layout.
 TypeScript: To handle logic.

 Think of components as reusable, self-contained blocks of code that control a specific part of your app, like a login form, navigation bar, or user profile card.

----- Lesson #1
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'my-angular-app';
}

 @Component Decorator: This is how you define a component. It tells Angular what HTML, CSS, and other settings to use.

 selector: This is the custom HTML tag you use to insert this component into your HTML, like <app-root></app-root>.
 templateUrl: Points to the HTML file of the component.
styleUrls: Links to the CSS file for styling.
AppComponent Class: This is where the logic resides. The title property is bound to the template. Right now, it says 'my-angular-app'.
my-first-component.component.spec.ts ( for testing )

To create component -> ng generate component my-first-component
