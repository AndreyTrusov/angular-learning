# My Angular Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my Angular projects repository! Over the past few weeks, I've been diving into Angular, mastering core concepts and building foundational projects. 

## Projects

### 1. Component Project

**Description**: In this project, I focused on understanding and working with Angular components. Components are the building blocks of Angular applications, and I learned how to:
- Create reusable components.
- Pass data between parent and child components using **@Input** and **@Output** decorators.
- Use Angular directives like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and custom directives to control DOM structure and behavior.

### 2. Forms Project

**Description**: This project focuses on Angular forms and user input handling. Forms are critical for collecting and validating user data, and here I practiced:
- Creating **Reactive Forms** and **Template-Driven Forms**.
- Adding form validation with built-in validators and custom validators.
- Handling form events, managing form states, and implementing error messages to enhance user experience.


### 3. HTTP Requests

**Description**: In this project, I explored making HTTP requests in Angular, a key feature for communicating with external APIs. I worked on:
- Using Angular's **HttpClient** to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- Implementing data models and services to structure API interactions cleanly.

### 4. My Angular App

**Description**: This is a comprehensive project combining multiple Angular features into a single application. It showcases my ability to:
- Structure and organize a multi-feature Angular app.
- Use Angular services, routing, forms, and components together to build a cohesive application.
- Understand Angularâ€™s **dependency injection** system for service management across components.

### 5. Routing Project

**Description**: This project focuses on Angular routing, a key feature for single-page applications. Here, I learned how to:
- Set up Angular **RouterModule** to handle navigation within the app.
- Configure routes, including **child routes** and **lazy loading** for optimizing performance.
- Use **Route Guards** to protect certain pages and manage navigation based on authentication and permissions.
